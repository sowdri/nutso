# You can run this workflow using a different operating systems.
#
# The starter workflow configures jobs to run on Linux, using the GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runners. You can change the `runs-on` key to run your jobs on a different operating system.
#
# For example, you can use the GitHub-hosted Windows runners by specifying `runs-on: windows-latest`. Or, you can run on the GitHub-hosted macOS runners using `runs-on: macos-latest`.
#
# You can also run jobs in Docker containers, or you can provide a self-hosted runner that runs on your own infrastructure. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)."
